This example demonstrates how to deploy the IoT Hub module with Azure Diagnostic Settings enabled using Terraform. It provisions an IoT Hub and configures diagnostic logs and metrics to be sent to a specified destination, such as a Log Analytics workspace. This setup helps monitor and analyze IoT Hub activity for operational and security insights, following best practices for resource naming and region selection.

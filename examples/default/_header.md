# Default Example

This example deploys the IoT Hub module in its simplest form using Terraform. It provisions an Azure IoT Hub with minimal configuration, demonstrating the basic setup required to get started. Supporting resources such as a resource group are also created, and the deployment uses CAF-compliant naming and randomized Azure regions for best practices.
